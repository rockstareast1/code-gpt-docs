# Refactoring Legacy Code

CodeGPT can assist you in refactoring legacy code to improve readability, maintainability, and performance while preserving functionality.

---

### **Example Scenario**

Imagine you have a legacy Python function that calculates the factorial of a number. The original code is functional but inefficient and difficult to read:

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        result = n
        while n > 1:
            n -= 1
            result *= n
        return result
```

You want to refactor this code to make it more concise and Pythonic.

---

### **Example Prompt**

**`Can you help me refactor this factorial function for better readability and efficiency?`**

---

### **Example Response**

CodeGPT might provide the following refactored version of the function:

```python
def factorial(n):
    """Calculate the factorial of a number recursively."""
    if n < 1:
        raise ValueError("Input must be a positive integer.")
    return 1 if n == 1 else n * factorial(n - 1)
```

---

### **Benefits of the Refactor**

1. **Improved Readability**: The code is concise and easier to understand at a glance.  
2. **Error Handling**: The refactored function includes a check to ensure the input is a positive integer.  
3. **Scalability**: The recursive approach is standard and aligns with mathematical definitions.
