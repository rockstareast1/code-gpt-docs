# CodeGPT Chat

The CodeGPT Chat feature enhances your development experience by allowing you to engage in conversations with a Large Language Models (LLM) directly within your text editor. This tutorial will guide you through the steps to make the most of this powerful tool.

## How to Use:
### Open the Chat Tab:
- Navigate to the tools tab and click on `Chat.` By default, `Gpt-4o-Mini` will answer on the chat.
- Now the chat allows you `Clean` the chat or `Reload` the question
- If you request code, copy or paste it directly into the file with the `Insert code` button.

### Using Code Selection:
Select the desired code in your editor by level to share code snippets. The selected code will be automatically inserted into the chat interface, allowing CodeGPT to provide more accurate and context-specific responses. Call the function using `@`.

To read the name of the file or segment, you can use the slide bar to navigate through the name.

#### Context level

You have three levels of context:

- `Selected code`: manually selected code
- `Codebase`: we auto-select the codebase
- `Deep insights`: we enrich the responses with code knowledge graphs.

### Configuration

Enable it, and AI will be able to understand the context of your code.
