# Vision

The Vision button is a powerful tool for analyzing images and extracting meaningful information. 

## How to use

- Please ensure you have connected with CodeGPT Plus or Ollama.
- Upload an image to use as a prompt for the model (only .jpg, .png, .webp format).

You can identify and locate objects within the image. The model can then provide details such as the object type, position, size, and color.

:::note Ask about the text within the images
